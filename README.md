# Julia API for Python Keyring API  

I admittedly do not have the requisite skills or time to implement
something like <https://github.com/jaraco/keyring> or
<https://github.com/r-lib/keyring> in native Julia myself.  
(I know not C)

HOWEVER, I believe this is something that should:  

1. be done eventually
2. at least be done by calling, say, python to make use of the keyring API there

## Jon this is weird why the hecc are you doing this?  Aren't there better options?

1. No :)
2. I'd like to learn some Julia!  
3. I'd like to raise awareness that this package is sorely missing.

## Julia packages this package relies on
