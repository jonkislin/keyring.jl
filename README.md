# Julia API for Python Keyring API  

I admittedly do not yet have the requisite skills or time to implement
a native keyring package such as those that exist in [python](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) or
[R](https://github.com/r-lib/keyring).

HOWEVER, I believe this is something that should:  

1. be done eventually
2. at least be done by calling, say, python to make use of the keyring API there

## Q: This is tacky. Aren't there better options?

1. I don't know of any :)
2. I'd like to learn some Julia!  
3. I'd like to raise awareness that this package is sorely missing.
